# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# Chatbox

Simple full-stack react chat application

## Technology stack
* React
* react-router
* create-react-app
* NodeJS
* MongoDB
* GraphQL
* Apollo Server
* Apollo-React

## Initialize

#### `npm install` at root level
#### `npm install` at ./server level

#### `npm start` at root level
#### `npm start` at ./server level

The application should be running afterwards

# Application description
Create-React-App application made only for learning purposes. The main idea of the app is to establish connection between multiple users and all of them to get the latest data(messages) at the same time. To achieve this I have decided to use Apollo server. GraphQL is used for fethcing messages and extracting only the information we need.
Along with that I am using Material UI in order to style components.



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
