# Application description
Create-React-App application made only for learning purposes. The main idea of the app is to establish connection between multiple users and all of them to get the latest data(messages) at the same time. To achieve this I have decided to use Apollo server. GraphQL is used for fethcing messages and extracting only the information we need.
Along with that I am using Material UI in order to style components.

### Other create-react-app scripts

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`
#### `npm run test`
